📊 Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes
This project demonstrates a Naive Bayes-based sentiment analysis on product reviews from Amazon. The goal is to classify each review as either positive or negative, using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Naive Bayes classifier.

🚀 Features
Reads and processes Amazon review data from a CSV file

Cleans and prepares textual data using NLP techniques:

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lowercasing

Punctuation cleaning

Transforms text into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization

Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes model

Evaluates the model with accuracy score and classification metrics

Visualizes the distribution of sentiments

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas – for data handling

scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

NLTK – for natural language preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for basic visualization

🧠 How it Works
Load the dataset: Reads a CSV file of Amazon reviews.

Preprocess text: Clean and normalize textual data.

Feature extraction: Apply TF-IDF to convert text to vectors.

Model training: Fit a Naive Bayes classifier to the data.

Evaluation: Use classification metrics to evaluate accuracy and performance.
